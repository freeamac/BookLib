A new book gets added but the display does not put it in correct alpha sequence. eg. 
Added "Towers of Midnight" and it got added at the end of the Ts, not in the middle where
it should be.
If you then save and exit, upon return, the sort will be still be wrong

In fact, if you sort by book author and save, that is the way it will be presented the next
time you open the app.
